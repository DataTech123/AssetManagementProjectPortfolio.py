The purpose of this project tracks on asset costs and use transaction records in accounting systems. I can also utilize other Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, for financial data trend analysis and data chart visualization to gain insights into the vendor supply (asset) system. 

An example is that I use Pandas library in VS code. In this project, I connect the internal asset management database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to Visual Studio Code to extract the total cost, total depreciation value, and total cost and depreciation value in accounting by using variables to list asset names.

The project includes only basic syntax (programming languages). However, if I coordinate with the database management and IT teams, I can collaborate with the organization on more complex coding statements.

Thank you for your review. I welcome any questions for further development.
