This project portfolio includes an example of a Python script.  It can also utilize other Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the vendor supply (asset) system. In a case, the work project I connect internal supply transaction record systems or external files to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). From there, it can connect to Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for data set exploration from multidimensional systems.
Thank you for your review. I welcome any questions about the project content.
