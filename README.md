This project is an example of using a Pandas library in a Python script. It can also utilize other Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, for financial data trend analysis and data chart visualization to gain insights into the vendor supply (asset) system. In this project, I connect the internal asset management database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to Visual Studio Code, so that extracts of a total cost, total depreciation value, and total cost and depreciation value at accounting by using variables to list asset names.
